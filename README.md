# ANTONalog -- A ttihp0p3 (Tiny Tapeout IHP) test project 

This isn't really anything yet. It will hopefully be Anton's Analog experiment on Tiny Tapeout IHP.

- [Read the documentation for this project](docs/info.md)


# Outstanding

*   I didn't do any LVS
*   Output buffer cells going into the DACs are meant to be buf_16, but OpenLane is resizing them even though I configured it not to.
*   No simulation done (though the Verilog was mostly tested in preparing TT08)
